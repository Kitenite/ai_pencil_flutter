# Ai Pencil

The official Ai Pencil client

## Web deployment
The project is set up with CI/CD for web. See our [Firebase hosting site](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ai-pencil/hosting/sites) for more information. Push or merges to main are automatically deployed.

For manual deployment from local, run:
```
flutter build web
firebase deploy
```

Deployment configuration changes can be made in `.github/workflows`. We may want to change our release branch in the future.

## Run code generation
We're using [json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable/example) which generates boilerplate code to encode and decode models to json. 

To generate this code, run:
```
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

## Generate icons
Icons for publishing are generated by [flutter_launcher_icons](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons). 

To generate new icon, replace the `assets/icon/icon.png` file and run:
```
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```

## Font Awesome Icons
We'll use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons rather than Material. Browse from their home page.
